# Post-Task Commands

After completing any development task, run the following commands to ensure code quality:

1. **Lint and Format Check**: `pnpm lint`
   - Runs ESLint to check for code issues
   - Runs Prettier to check formatting

2. **Auto-fix and Format**: `pnpm format`
   - Auto-fixes ESLint issues where possible
   - Formats code with Prettier

These commands should be run before committing changes to maintain consistent code quality and style across the project.
